//! OpenResearch CLI (`orx`) — Rust port entry point.

//! A clap-derive command tree mirroring the USAGE
//! block, dispatched from an async `tokio::main`. Each subcommand routes to one
//! module fn in `commands::<name>`. The six fs verbs (read/write/str-replace/

//! Error handling: command fns return `anyhow::Result<()>`. `main` prints the
